# info
This is a module i make which basically, encrypt text and stores it into binary! It's a custom text encoding for each different key.
There are too chinese characters that resemble \n and " because there are problems trying to load this with print() or the discord bot message function. Yeah, I used this in my discord bot at https://github.com/BBernYY/pommiebot. its in another language though, and since I made it for another person I can't really change the language easily. I'll see though.
# how to use
You can use this as a python module, or with the executer file I included. It also requires a key, even if you have this program, you still won't be able to know other people's binary without the code. Since the files are stored as raw data, the byte size is 1 byte letter. About as big as .txt files, so you can literally save the entire bee movie 500 times script and it would take up the size of an image. You can make keys using getKey and choose if these are returned in the function, or printed to the console.
